Lionbite Games is a newly founded indie development studio in Stockholm, Sweden where we are focused on creating our own unique, quality-over-quantity video game experiences. You can read more about who we are under the conveniently named tab “the people“.

We’re always looking for talented people to work with, so don’t hesitate to get in touch. You can reach us by e-mailing info@lionbite.se and find us on location at Hästholmsvägen 25 (ain’t that a mouthful). For media inquiries, it’s instead simply press@lionbite.se.  Either way, we look forward to hearing from you. Thanks for stopping by!'
